# Gap Analysis Case Study – Financial Company (Oklahoma City)

This project demonstrates my work as a **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) consultant** performing a **gap analysis** for a fictional financial services company based in Oklahoma City. The goal of this case study is to show how I approach identifying compliance gaps, regulatory risks, and operational weaknesses, and then deliver practical recommendations aligned with industry frameworks.

---

##  Project Overview

**Client:** RedRock Financial Services (Fictional)  
**Industry:** Banking, lending, and wealth management  
**Size:** ~500 employees, HQ in Oklahoma City + 2 branch offices  
**Data Handled:** Personally Identifiable Information (PII), credit reports, financial records  

The company is subject to oversight by regulators including the **OCC**, **FDIC**, **SEC**, and the **Oklahoma Department of Consumer Credit**.

---

##  Frameworks Applied

For this assessment, I applied multiple governance and security standards to evaluate maturity and compliance:

- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**
- **ISO 27001**
- **FFIEC IT Handbook**
- **GLBA (Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act)**
- **PCI DSS**

---

##  Key Gaps Identified

The gap analysis revealed weaknesses across governance, cybersecurity, compliance, and operations.

| **Domain** | **Gap** | **Impact** | **Priority** |
|------------|---------|------------|--------------|
| Governance & Oversight | Board receives IT updates but lacks structured cybersecurity oversight | Potential OCC/FDIC findings | **High** |
| Risk Management | No documented enterprise risk appetite | Misaligned decisions between IT and business | Medium |
| Policy Framework | Missing vendor risk and incident response policies | Regulatory and audit exposure | High |
| Data Protection | Inconsistent encryption (cloud vs. local servers) | Customer data at risk | High |
| Access Controls | MFA not enforced for VPN/internal admins | Elevated cyber risk | High |
| Vendor Risk Mgmt | No annual vendor reassessments | Third-party exposure | Medium |
| Incident Response | No recent tabletop testing | Low readiness for breaches | High |
| Business Continuity | Last BCP test was 3 years ago | Downtime risk | Medium |
| Employee Training | No phishing simulations | Social engineering risk | Medium |
| Audit & Monitoring | No centralized SIEM | Delayed threat detection | High |

---

##  Observations

- **Governance Weaknesses**: Board not fully engaged in cybersecurity oversight  
- **Cybersecurity Gaps**: MFA, encryption, and SIEM need urgent remediation  
- **Compliance Risks**: GLBA and PCI DSS compliance at risk  
- **Operational Risks**: Outdated business continuity and incident response plans  

---

##  Recommendations

### Immediate (0–3 Months)
- Enforce **MFA** across all systems (VPN, admin accounts).  
- Draft missing **policies** (vendor risk, incident response, acceptable use).  
- Encrypt all local servers storing customer data.  
- Run a **tabletop exercise** to test incident response readiness.  

### Short Term (3–6 Months)
- Document an **enterprise risk appetite**.  
- Provide **structured cybersecurity reporting** to the board.  
- Deploy a **SIEM** for centralized log management.  
- Launch **phishing simulation training**.  

### Long Term (6–12 Months)
- Formalize **vendor risk management** with annual reassessments.  
- Update and test **BCP/DR plans** annually.  
- Move toward **ISO 27001 alignment** in policies and controls.  
- Create a **compliance dashboard** to track GLBA, PCI DSS, and OCC obligations.

##  Visualization

As part of the analysis, I created a **heatmap-style visualization** highlighting priorities.  
Red = High Risk, Orange = Medium Risk, Green = Low Risk. 

---

##  Conclusion

This project highlights my ability to conduct a **deep GRC gap analysis** by:  

- Aligning assessments with regulatory and security frameworks  
- Translating findings into **business language** executives understand  
- Delivering **practical, prioritized recommendations**  
- Using data visualization to drive board-level awareness  

This is a strong example of my **consulting methodology** in action and how I help financial institutions strengthen governance, reduce risk, and maintain regulatory compliance.
